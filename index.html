					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					
					<p>My goals in this talk:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Explain why technical sales demos fail</li>
						<li>Introduce the Great Demo method</li>
						<li>Demonstrate a Great Demo</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Peter Cohan's book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9SNKC2Y">Great Demo! How to create and execute stunning software demonstrations</a> is the primary resource for this talk.</p>

					<h3>A Quick Note</h3>
					
					<p>You're not in technical pre-sales? That's okay--neither am I!</p>
					
					<p>But we can also perform the equivalent of pre-sales <strong>inside the organization</strong>. Are you selling other teams on your team's services? Then you're still doing pre-sales!</p>

					<h3>The Typical Sales Demo</h3>
					
					<p>Have you ever experienced a poor technical sales demo?</p>
					
					<p>What makes for a bad demo?</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/wrongway.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Causes of Failure</h3>
					
					<ol>
						<li>The "harbor tour"</li>
						<li>The canned, generic demo</li>
						<li>The unprepared demoer: sticking to the "happy path"</li>
						<li>The demoer making the app appear overly complicated</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/chess-loss.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Summarizing Failure</h3>
					
					<ol>
						<li>"They never showed what I really needed to see"</li>
						<li>"It took forever and I lost track"</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>These are the most common reasons why technical sales demos fail.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/plan.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>The Solution: Do the last Thing First!</h3>
					
					<p>Begin by showing what people want to see. Let people know up-front that we can solve the relevant issue.</p>
					
					<p>This is critical because "power walks first"--the most important people in a meeting typically have the strongest constraints on their time and may not be able to wait until minute 57 of a 60-minute meeting to learn what they need.</p>

					<h3>Introduce the Situation</h3>
					
					<p>What is the Critical Business Issue your customer is experiencing?</p>
					
					<p>Think of a Critical Business Issue as something fitting the pattern:</p>

					<p><code>"I am unable to {do something} because {reason}, and therefore {problem}."</code></p>
					
					<p>"I am unable to get good metrics on employee absenteeism because it takes six weeks to get absence information in my report, and therefore I am not able to plan project work efficiently."</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/chain.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Critical Business Issue</h3>
					
					<p>Note that a CBI may exhibit differently at different levels of the organization!</p>
					
					<p><em>"I am unable to get good metrics on employee absenteeism because it takes six weeks to get absence information in my report, and therefore I am not able to plan project work efficiently."</em></p>
					
					<p>"I am unable to enter absence information into the payroll system in a timely manner because employees submit time cards once every two weeks and may correct their entries over the next four weeks, and therefore the application will not make report results available until reconciliation completes."</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/connections.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Introduce the Situation</h3>
					
					<p>What are the specific capabilities you offer to solve this problem?</p>
					
					<p>"Our payroll system immediately surfaces absences and you can see this information in one of our built-in reports."</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/measure.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Introduce the Situation</h3>
					
					<p>What is the Delta? In other words, what is the value of your specific capability to the customer?</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Our solution is cheaper / better / faster / not previously possible</li>
						<li>Measure in terms of calendar time, employee hours, necessary headcount, or money</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/calendar.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Introduce the Situation</h3>
					
					<p>What is the critical date? When does the solution need to be in place?</p>
					
					<p>Companies tend to move on deadline. If there isn't a critical date, this may actually be a barrier to success!</p>

					<h3>Present the Illustration</h3>
					
					<p>This section should take no more than 1-2 minutes!</p>
					
					<p>After showing this, ask, "Would you like to learn more about how to do this?" This helps affirm customer interest and drives engagement.</p>
					
					<p>And if the customer says no, you're not wasting their time!<p>

					<h3>Do It!</h3>
					
					<p>Assuming the customer is still interested, perform your most direct demonstration.</p>
					
					<p>Begin at a logical starting point: a home page or other "starting" position.</p>
					
					<p>Then, choose the path to get to your illustration.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/goals.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Do It!</h3>
					
					<p>Your goals for the demonstration:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Get from the starting point to the illustration</li>
						<li>Minimize the number of mouse clicks or operations to get through your demo</li>
						<li>Show that your application is easy to use</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>To do that, stay focused and disciplined--don't go on a harbor tour! This should take you 1-3 minutes.</p>

					<h3>Peel Back the Layers</h3>
					
					<p>You've shown the quick-and-painless way of getting what the customer wants. Now we do it again! Why?</p>
					
					<p>The first go-around was for management to see that it's possible.</p>
					
					<p>The second go-around is for employees, who are now paying attention. It also lets you expand on your quick and easy solution.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/onions.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Peel Back the Layers</h3>
					
					<p>Tips for peeling back the layers:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Walk through the process again, but expand on it</li>
						<li>This should take you 5-10 minutes</li>
						<li>This is where you can discuss the breadth and depth of options</li>
						<li>You can also let <strong>great</strong> audience questions drive the discussion</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/questions.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Audience Questions</h3>
					
					<p>There are three types of audience question:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Great</strong> questions directly impact the specific capability the customer needs and what we are demonstrating. "Can you host it on Linux instead of Windows?" "Can you include data from this other report?"</li>
						<li><strong>Good</strong> questions deserve a response but can derail the demo. Capture those in a 'not now' list and respond to them at the end or offline.</li>
						<li><strong>Stupid</strong> questions come from people trying to trip you up or people who are completely misunderstanding. Treat those as Good questions.</li>
					</ul>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/skeleton-thinking.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Q&A</h3>
					
					<p>Q&A is your opportunity to go back over the Not Now list and answer customer questions in the remaining time. The process is:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Restate the question and ask if you understand it correctly</li>
						<li>Provide a clear and sufficient answer</li>
						<li>Summarize both the question and the answer</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/rollercoaster.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Q&A</h3>
					
					<p>Q&A is also a chance for customers to ask you to show them additional specific capabilities.</p>
					
					<p>If you <strong>can</strong> present the specific capability, do so in the Great Demo fashion: present the illustration, do it quickly, do it thoroughly, take Q&A.</p>
					
					<p>If you <strong>cannot</strong> present the specific capability, say so. Either set up a separate meeting to demonstrate it, or explain why you cannot demonstrate it.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/robot.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Q&A</h3>
					
					<p>What about specific examples from customers?</p>
					
					<p>Yes! These are a great opportunity to gain goodwill, assuming you understand your product well enough.</p>
					
					<p>But be sure to explain the range of possible outcomes: might not have all of the relevant data in our demo environment, might not get back an expected result, etc.</p>

					<h3>Final Summary</h3>
					
					<p>The closing summary is your way to wrap up what the customers have learned about this demo.</p>
					
					<p>It is critical to use the final summary to tie your demonstration back to the delta, to ensure the customer makes the connection.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/employees.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Trying this Out</h3>
					
					<p>The (hypothetical) situation: you are developers, dev managers, DBAs, and architects wanting to learn how to get to code from a Catallaxy Services talk.</p>
					
					<p>CBI: You are unable to get great examples of awesome code because you do not know how to get to the demo code, and therefore you are losing out on being more productive.</p>
					
					<p>Specific capability: Catallaxy Services offers a repo for each presentation!</p>
					
					<p>The Delta: You can write <strong>better</strong> code and save <strong>up to 906</strong> hours per year by writing code more efficiently and effectively.</p>

				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/wrappingup.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

					<p>Over the course of this talk, we learned about the Great Demo approach to performing technical demonstrations. We learned several techniques for laying out an effective demonstration to an audience, one that increases the likelihood of a successful sale (or "internal sale").</p>
