This repository provides the supporting code for my presentation entitled [Delivering a Great Demo!](https://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/delivering-a-great-demo/).

## The Basis of the Talk

This talk is based on the book [Great Demo! How to Create and Execute Stunning Software Demonstrations](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9SNKC2Y) by Peter Cohan.

The talk serves as my take on the topic and materials.
